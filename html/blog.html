                thrill ride that captures the adrenaline and danger of the sport. <br>
                
                Starring Chris Hemsworth as the charismatic British driver James Hunt and Daniel Brühl as the methodical Austrian Niki
                Lauda, the film follows the two drivers as they battle for the championship, both on and off the track. The movie is as
